# finite-element
This repository implements the Finite Element Method (FEM) to numerically approximate solutions to certain elliptic Partial Differential Equations, following the methodology defined in Professor Iain Smears' course, MATH0092: Variational Methods for Partial Differential Equations.

The current implementation handles the one-dimensional case (Ordinary Differential Equations) and supports Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundary conditions. The basis functions are implemented up to piecewise quadratic functions (P2).
