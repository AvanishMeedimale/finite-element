Implementing the Finite Element method to numerically approximate solutions to PDEs

works for neumann/dirichlet/robin conditions
and only for elliptic pde of a certain form. Since this is only 1D, then these are essentially ODEs.

Currently only implemented P1 finite element approximation, could add higher degree of polynomial approximation later.
